A study on the performance of an application implemented with different architectures.

### Application
We will build an online textbook catalog for students. This application will be implemented in the architectures mentioned below.

## Architectures
MVC

Layered

Event-Driven

Microservice

## Load Testing
JMeter

## Sources

Textbook Data Retrieved From: https://uvabookstores.com/uvatext/site_textbooklist.asp
University Data Retrieved From: https://ope.ed.gov/dapip/#/home (U.S Department of Education)
  - Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs


## How we are measuring performance?

We will use several scenarios that mirror a typical user flow for this type of application. For your own application, you will have to develop your own scenarios that reflect your users.

Scenarios we will use:
- User searches for his/her university, clicks on the desired department, clicks on the desired course, clicks on the desired textbook & stops
- Same as above but orders a textbook
- Editing an order
- Cancel/destroy an order
